"""
A set up tools to help analyze the simulations

Subpackages
----------

tools.checklog
  parses through the log file while a simulation is running
  and plots time/step v time [Gyrs] where each restart is a 
  different color

tools.cosmography
  some simple (but needing update) programs to calculate
  cosmological time, distance for a given redshift

tools.fixdecomp
  will create a tipsy array file to read into tipsy/salsa to mark 
  particles of each classification a different color

tools.fof2stat
  Fof is a quick halo finder to run for quick results. This creates a 
  stat file from the grp/gtp outputs

tools.fofscript
  Creates a bash script to run fof on all snapshots in a directory.
  Currently depends on some previous runs to calculate the correct
  linking length. I need to fix that. 

tools.mvfof2amiga
  Pynbody expects .amiga.grp files, this converts the fof outputs to
  filenames that pynbody will accept. This means that amiga.grp files
  in a directory might not be run by amiga :/

tools.nptipsyreader
   The reason I started this project. Pynbody originally wasn't compiling
   on some of the supercomputers so I wrote this code as a way to read in 
   sims to get units and such quickly. It reads large files in wicked fast
   and reads in the param file, calculating some units for you

tools.readstat
  Expects a certain structure of the stat file, but will read it in. I need
  to add additional options for the strutcture of the stat file depending
  on which halo finder created it. Also Rockstar's natural outputs

tools.starlog
  Reads in a starlog file, and converts units to Msol, Gyr
